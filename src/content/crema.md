Saught out Crema because I loved their values around building 
good products for users and customers.  This included 
working collaboratively in an agile environment allowing all roles to
contribute

Spent half my tenure here 
helping start-ups build out their product ideas and the 
other half helping enterprise organizations build out their 
internal tools.

Currently I consult with our clients to build the best version 
of their product as possible working with their teams and bringing
in specialized help as needed while using collaboration and research tools
and lean methodologies.
